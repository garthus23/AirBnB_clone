# AirBnB_clone

it will be the clone of the AirBnB Website !

* The Console :

 -  Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances.
 -  Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
 -  Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel.
 -  Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
 -  Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.
